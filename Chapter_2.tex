	We assume a forward voltage for the LED of 1.5\V. Then for $I_{LED}$ we have
	\[I_{LED} = \frac{V_R}{R} = \frac{3.3\V - 1.5\V}{330\Ohm} \approx \sol{5.5\m\A}\]
	To estimate the $\beta_{min}$ we need the current entering the base
	\[I_B = \frac{3.3\V - 0.6\V}{10\k\Ohm} = 0.27\m\A \]
	Thus
	\[\beta_{min} \geq \frac{I_{LED}}{I_B} = \sol{20}\]

	Starting from the hint that the capacitor charges from $-4.4\V$ towards $+5\V$, we would result to a total $9.4\V$ for a full charge. However, the $V_{BE}$ of $Q_2$ is clipping the charging process at only $5\V$ of the total (from $-4.4\V$ to $0.6\V$). Thus, the capacitor will be $53\%$ charged at the end. \\Solving the voltage equation for a charging capacitor gives us
	\[V_C(t) = V_f * (1 - e^{-\frac{t}{R C}})\]
	set $V_C(t_1) = 0.53 * V_f$
	\[0.53 = 1 - e^{-\frac{t_1}{R_3 C_1}}\]
	\[\Rightarrow\]
	\[t_1 = - R C*ln(0.47) \approx \sol{0.76 * R_3 C_1}\]
